INSTALL:
    Command Structure:
    # node index.js install <ServiceDisplayName> <PathToScriptFile> <OptionalDescription>
    ServiceDisplayName = The display name property to be listed in the Windows services list
    PathToScriptFile = The path to the javascript file

    The "daemon" directory will be create in the same directory as your source code file specificed in the <PathToScriptFile>

    Installing does not always work perfectly with permissions. You may need to modify how the service runs after it is installed.
    1. open windows services
    2. Locate the service by the display name you set
    3. Right click -> properties
    4. Log On tab
    5. Select "This Account" and browse for the local admin account or desired service account
    6. enter the password for the chosen account

    Example:
    # node index.js install APIToolServer ..\apiserver\index.js

Uninstall:
    Command structure:
    # node index.js uninstall <ServiceDisplayName> <FilePathToDaemonDirectory>
    ServiceDisplayName = The display name property listed in the Windows services list
    FilePathToDaemonDirectory = The path to a directory named Daemon, likely where the source code is located
                                For example, if code is at C:\temp\mycode\index.js
                                The daemon directory is likely at C:\temp\mycode\daemon

    Example:
    # node index.js uninstall APIToolServer ..\apiserver\daemon
